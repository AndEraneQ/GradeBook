# Electronic Gradebook 
## Project Description:
Electronic Gradebook is a web application based on user roles that allows tracking and managing students grades. The system is divided into three main roles:
Administrator, Teacher, and Student. Each role is assigned specific permissions and access to certain functions of the system. <br>

If the link to the YouTube video isn’t displayed here, it means I’m currently finishing the visual part of the project.
The link will be updated soon, but feel free to check out the project on your own!

## Roles and Functions:
### 1. Administrator
The Administrator manages the entire system, having full access to all of its functions, including: <br>
• Managing subjects: Adding, removing, and editing subjects, as well as assigning teachers to specific subjects. <br>
• Managing users: Creating accounts for new users (teachers, students), editing their information, and the ability to delete a user. <br>
• Managing classes: Adding, removing, and editing classes. The Administrator can assign homeroom teachers,
teachers responsible for teaching specific classes, and students to classes. <br>
### 2. Teacher
The Teacher only has access to the classes they teach and can: <br>
• Manage grades: Adding, editing, and viewing students' grades in the classes they are responsible for. <br>
• If a teacher is assigned as a homeroom teacher, they also have access to all grades of students in their class. <br>
### 3. Student
A Student has the ability to: <br>
• Track their own grades: Students can view their grades and monitor their progress. <br>
### Common Functions for All Roles:
• Editing personal data: Each user can edit their personal information. The Administrator has the authority to edit the data of all users.  <br>
• User communication: The system includes a built-in messaging feature that allows users to communicate with each other. <br>
## Tools Used in the Project:
1. Backend:
Java 21, 
Spring Boot, 
Spring Security, 
Spring Data JPA, 
Hibernate, 
JWT (JSON Web Token), 
JUnit, 
AssertJ, 
Mockito, 
Testcontainers.
2. FrontEnd:
HTML, 
CSS, 
JavaScript, 
React.
## Conclusion:
Building Gradebook application taught me a lot about both backend and frontend development.
I gained practical experience with tools like Spring Boot and React, and learned how to create secure systems using technologies
like JWT for authentication. I also improved my skills in setting up role-based access, which helps control what different users can do.

Writing tests using JUnit, AssertJ, and Mockito showed me how important it is to make sure everything works correctly
before deploying the project. Overall, this project helped me grow as a developer and gave me valuable insights into creating useful applications.
